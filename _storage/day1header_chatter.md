#TOP LEVEL GRAPHIC CHATTER

For years, Cook County’s convoluted property tax system has helped hide racial and wealth disparities and other persistent problems in residential assessments. 

The Tribune analyzed more than 100 million property tax records. The investigation took more than a year and was vetted by top experts.

##Map #1 (valuation map)

The problem lies with the fundamentally flawed way the county assessor’s office values property. By comparing assessments to actual home sales, it became apparent that ... 

... some areas were overvalued ...

... while others were undervalued.

##Chart #1 (regressivity_table.csv)

Lower-priced homes tend to be overvalued while higher-priced ones are undervalued. The assesor's office has ignored industry standards designed to catch the problem. 

##Map #2 (tract_erate.csv)

Property tax bills are skewed because they rely on these flawed valuations.

The ratio of property taxes to a home's sale price — the **effective tax rate** — for countywide taxes, shows  that some neighborhoods are paying more than others.

##Chart #2 (cook_erate_medhinc_table.csv)

The effective tax rate should be the same for all homes.

But the data show that working-class neighborhoods are more likely to receive property tax bills that are larger relative to the value of their homes than those living in wealthier communities.  

##Chart #3 (cook_erate_pctwht_table)

Because affluent areas are far more likely to be majority white non-Hispanic, racial and ethnic minorities as a group end up shouldering an unfair share of the tax burden. 

As one expert put it: “It’s a textbook example of institutional racism.”
